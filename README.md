# Hogwarts-Sorting-Hat
Legend has it that the hat once belonged to one of the four founders, Godric Gryffindor, and that it was jointly enchanted by all four founders to ensure that students would be sorted into their eponymous houses, which would be selected according to each founder's particular preferences in students.

'Oh you may not think I'm pretty, <br />
But don't judge on what you see,  <br />
I'll eat myself if you can find<br />
A smarter hat than me.<br />


You can keep your bowlers black,<br />
Your top hats sleek and tall,<br />
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat<br />
And I can cap them all.<br />


There's nothing hidden in your head<br />
The Sorting Hat can't see,<br />
So try me on and I will tell you<br />
Where you ought to be.<br />


You might belong in Gryffindor,<br />
Where dwell the brave at heart,<br />
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry<br />
Set Gryffindors apart;<br />


You might belong in Hufflepuff,<br />
Where they are just and loyal,<br />
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true<br />
And unafraid of toil;<br />


Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,<br />
if you've a ready mind,<br />
Where those of wit and learning,<br />
Will always find their kind;<br />


Or perhaps in Slytherin<br />
You'll make your real friends,<br />
Those cunning folks use any means<br />
To achieve their ends.<br />


So put me on! Don't be afraid!<br />
And don't get in a flap!<br />
You're in safe hands (though I have none)<br />
For I'm a Thinking Cap!'<br />
